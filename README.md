# ARC4 ABI compliant ERC20 implementation

This is purely for educational purposes and I don't encourage using it in any
projects or on Mainnet.
Algorand has a built-in native primative for creating tokens, the Algorand
Standard Asset (ASA), and should be the first consideration when creating an
ERC20-like token on Algorand.

Use only in a sandbox enviornment on a private network. You will need to update
the JSON file to contain your genesis hash and appID.

Pull requests welcome.
